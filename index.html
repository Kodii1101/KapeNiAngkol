            As a future athlete you just started your practice for an upcoming
            event. Given that on the first day you run x kilometers, and by the
            event you must be able to run y kilometers. Calculate the number of
            days required for you to finally reach the required distance for the
            event, if you increase your distance each day by 10% from the
            previous day. Print one integer representing the number of days to
            reach the required distance.
